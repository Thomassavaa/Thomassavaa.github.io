Education
======
* B.S. in Astronomy, Boston University, 2019-2023
* B.S. in Physics, Boston University, 2019-2023
* M.S in Earth and Planetary Sciences, Earth-Life Science Institute, Institute of Science Tokyo, 2025-Present (Completion planned Spring 2027)

Work experience
======
  * Sep. 2023 - Sep. 2024: Research Technician
    * MIT Kavli Institute, [LLAMAS](https://www.mit.edu/~rsimcoe/llamas/instrument.html) team
    * Duties included optical alignment and calibration of 24 CCD cameras to ensure precise spectrograph performance; development and integration of a Python-based control system managing over 50 TCP/IP devices—including CCDs, Raspberry Pis, and sensors—to optimize communication and functionality; and design of telemetry databases and visualization tools to monitor and display real-time system statuses from hundreds of measurements across the instrument.
    * Supervisor: [Gabor Furesz](https://www.space.mit.edu/people/gabor-furesz/)

  * Jan 2022 - Jun 2022: Mechanical Design Engineer
    * European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) - DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) team
    * Duties included designing, assembling, and testing two prototype charge readout plane models for DUNE, contributing to the development of components for a next-generation neutrino detector; creating CAD models for multiple 3×3 m readout planes with variations in material composition, anode configuration, and RC circuitry to improve precision and minimize noise; assembling prototypes in a cleanroom environment while handling high-end electronics such as PCBs; and testing readout performance within Faraday cages and cryogenic cold boxes to evaluate electronic functionality under low-temperature conditions.
    * Supervisor: [Tiziano Camporesi](https://www.bu.edu/physics/profile/tiziano-camporesi/)


Research Experience
======
  * Aug. 2022 – May. 2023: Research Assistant
    * Boston University - _Perkins Remote Observation_
    * Developed Python-based software to enable remote operation of the Perkins Telescope in Flagstaff, Arizona, increasing observational efficiency by removing the need for on-site observers. Designed and implemented a full-featured graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter for intuitive control by novice users, and integrated hardware communication through a relay system that transmitted commands from the host computer directly to the telescope.
    * Supervisor: [Philip Muirhead](https://www.bu.edu/astronomy/profile/phil-muirhead/)

  * Jun. 2021 – Oct. 2021: Research Assistant
    * Boston University  - _CoCoA Support_
    * Collected and analyzed observational data of early-stage, high-mass stars within infrared dark clouds to determine physical parameters such as mass and luminosity. Utilized astrophotometry Python tools to extract data from protostellar outflows and applied the astrodendro package to identify and classify dense structures as candidate high-mass protostars. Compiled and organized results using tabulate to generate structured data tables for subsequent analysis.
    * Supervisor: [Thushara Pillai](https://www.haystack.mit.edu/researcher/thushara-g-s-pillai/)
