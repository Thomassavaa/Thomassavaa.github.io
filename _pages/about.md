### **About Me**

I was born in São Paulo, Brazil in 2001 and raised in Miami, Florida, USA, since 2006. I attended Boston University, earning a double major in Astronomy and Physics in 2023, and have been attending the Institute of Science Tokyo since April 2025. I worked as a software engineer/technician at the MIT Kavli Institute on the LLAMAS instrument, and I now conduct research at the [Earth-Life Science Institute](https://www.elsi.jp/en/) (ELSI) under the supervision of [Prof. Yasuhito Sekine](https://www.elsi.jp/en/members/researchers/ysekine/).

I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree and will subsequently work toward my PhD in the Astrobiology course at ELSI. My Master’s research is quite varied in scope but primarily focuses on exploring prebiotic chemistry at some of its earliest and most primitive stages.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time alone taking photos with my camera or exploring Tokyo and its surrounding towns and mountains with friends.

### **Research Interest**

I have a broad interest in habitability on ancient Mars and present-day Enceladus, but my current focus is on aqueous reactions at some of the earliest prebiotic stages. Specifically, I have been studying the formose reaction and learning how certain prebiotic settings—such as alkaline lakes on Mars and the Enceladus seafloor—can direct it toward a more favorable set of products for prebiotic chemistry.

I am probing this in several ways by experimenting with minerals and mineral buffers expected in these environments, and I later plan to introduce hydrogen sulfide as a reduced form of sulfur capable of further directing the chemistry.

While the core exploration of chemical space centers on CHOS products, I am also investigating the possible roles that phosphate can play in carbonate–apatite–buffered systems, as well as the future incorporation of ammonia into these systems.

I am using [MØD](https://jakobandersen.github.io/mod/index.html), a chemical reaction space tool capable of stochastic simulations of the formose system (based on quantum chemical calculations and machine learning to fill in data gaps), to better predict what reactions occur in these one-pot systems. I aim to use experiments hand in hand with modeling to iteratively refine and deepen our understanding of reaction networks.

For now, my focus is limited to the formose system, but this approach has broader applications. In the future, I hope to explore carbonate lakes as plausible origin-of-life sites for both Mars and Hadean Earth and to develop more accurate laboratory recreations of these prebiotic environments. I am also interested in extending my work beyond moderate-temperature wet-lab chemistry into atmospheric and hydrothermal systems, among others.
